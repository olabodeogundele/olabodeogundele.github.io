title: About Me
---

I am a Healthcare Data Scientist with a Ph.D. in Health Informatics and a Graduate Certificate in Data Science from the University of Missouri-Columbia.

My experience spans healthcare analytics, machine learning, evaluation research, and decision support systems, with hands-on work using Electronic Health Records (EHR) and Medicaid claims data.

My work has contributed to peer-reviewed publications and data-driven insights supporting healthcare operations, policy, and population health initiatives.

I am seeking data science, healthcare analytics, and consulting roles where rigorous analysis and clear storytelling drive impact.
